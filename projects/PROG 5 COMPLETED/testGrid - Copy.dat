Foud a bug in my program:
use "breaktest.dat" and search for  'the es ss gh hvvs'.
It should be found but program will say phrase not found.
See breakoutput.txt to see what occured. 
Fix: need to somehow add a backtracking feature so that 
characters from table added to bool table are reset to false 
any time a word is not found and backtracking to the end of the previous word occurs -
all of those added positions from a partially found word or from words that are eventually backtracked
remain occupied (set to true) according to the bool table.
After resolving this hard-to-find bug then program should have no more bugs.
